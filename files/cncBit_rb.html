cncBit.rb
</p>
<p>
The loaded config files specifiy an array of
</p>
<pre>
 off RPM,  load per tooth and recomended maximum
 cut depth for each material.  These can be used by
 the local bit to calculate maximum depth and feed
 rates for a given bit.

 normal consensus is to always feed a shallow depth
 and move at a faster speed rather than take deep
 cuts.  this changes however when doing finsh cuts
 on sidewalls where we want to take the maximum
 cut depth allowed by the flute while reducing the
 amount of cut being taken into the sidewall and
 reducing speed.
</pre>
<p>
In generally we always equate everything to feed per tooth which we can
adjust for varying conditions. We get our maximum rpm for a given bit size
from the material however our local bit can adjust that setting such as
carbide which is allowed to take a larger bite per tooth and run to run at
a 100% higher RPM than high speed steel.
</p>
<p>
SFM = surface feet per min = RPM * cutter_diam * 0.262 Chip Load = Feed
Rate (in / min) / (RPM * number of cutting teeth)
</p>
<pre>
   Chiploads are generally set from 0.002 to 0.005 however
   aluminum can tolerate 0.15 when taking shallow cuts.
</pre>
<p>
feed per tooth is the bite of material each tooth takes as it comes around.
For example if a two flute bit is spinning at 1,000 RPM then is is taking
2000 cuts per minut or 2000 / 60 = 33 cuts per second so if we want it to
take 0.01 inchs per cut we would have to move it at a rate of 33 * 0.01 =
.33 inches per second or 19.8 inches per minute.
</p>
<p>
If the cut depth is increased then we have to decrease the feed rate by a
proportional amount. This will only matter if we need to finish cut a
sidewall so that we don&#8217;t see all the layered cuts.
</p>
<p>
this calculation is based on the a full width cut. when we take a
fractional cut we can increase the speed proportionally .
</p>
<p>
ips (inch_per_second) = (rpm / 60) * number_of_teeth) * per_tooth_load
</p>
<pre>
                          ((1000 * 60)* 2) * 0.01) = 0.33
</pre>
<p>
ips has to be adjusted for current cut depth
</p>
<pre>
    ips = ips * (recomended_cut_depth / (cur_cut_depth / recomended_cut_depth))
       so for a cut depth of 1&quot; when the recomended cut
       depth is 0.10  would solve as
   ips = old_ips (0.33) * (0.1 / (1.0 / 0.1) = 0.01

  ips also has to be adjusted for the cuting swath so
  so for a cutting swath that is only 1/4&quot; the full swath
  ips would be increased by 50%.  Only 50% of the bit cuts
  anyway to we have to deduct the other 50%
